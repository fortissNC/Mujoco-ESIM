# Mujoco-ESIM

This work addresses this issue using MuJoCo, a high performance physics engine, in combination with ESIM, an established event-generation method. To the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this is the first robotic simulator tool for generating event-based datasets specifically designed for the robotics domain.

The project has been rebased to the public gitlab repository:
